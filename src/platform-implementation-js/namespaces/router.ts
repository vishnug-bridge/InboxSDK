/**
 * This namespace contains functionality associated with creating your own content inside Gmail. It allows you to define "Routes" which define a full page of content and an associated URL space for which they are active. You can think of routes as different pages in your application. Gmail already have a few routes built in (Inbox, Sent, Drafts, etc). This namespace allows you to define your own as well as listen in on the built in routes being navigated to.

This is typically used when you want to create content to fill the main content area of Gmail. Every route has a URL associated with it and can have optional parameters. However, you never construct these URL's manually. The SDK will take care of creating a URL that will work in Gmail for your Route. Since these URL's may change due to implementations of Gmail, you should always create new links when trying to set URL on elements or simply use the goto function which naviagtes to the created link automatically. Using the handleX family of methods, you can specify which routes your application can handle. You will be called back with and instance of a RouteView or similar when the user navigates to a route you've declared you can handle. For custom routes, you'll typically add your own content and for built in routes, you'll typically modify the existing content. Route ID's are path like strings with named parameters, for example: "myroute/:someParamMyRouteNeeds".
